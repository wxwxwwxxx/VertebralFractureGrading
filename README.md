# Faint Features Tell: Automatic Vertebrae Fracture Screening Assisted by Contrastive Learning

## Overview

This is the code repository of paper *Faint Features Tell: Automatic Vertebrae Fracture Screening Assisted by Contrastive Learning* ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10698)). In this paper, we propose a supervised contrastive learning based model to estimate Genentâ€™s Grade of vertebral fracture with CT scans. Our method has a specificity of 99% and a sensitivity of 85% in binary classification, and a macro-F1 of 77% in multi-class classification. It can be concluded that forming feature space by contrastive learning facilitate CNN to capture the faint feature in the given images.
